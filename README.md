MVCSS-Stylus
=====

Origin
------

MVCSS is a Sass-based CSS architecture for creating predictable and maintainable application style.

MVCSS is awesome, and we need a Stylus version.

Compiling
---------

If you want to compile MVCSS-Stylus into an `application.css` (and `application.min.css`)
file, you'll need to first install [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/):

```shell
npm install -g stylus
```

And then run:

```shell
stylus application.styl
```

You should now have compiled CSS files.
